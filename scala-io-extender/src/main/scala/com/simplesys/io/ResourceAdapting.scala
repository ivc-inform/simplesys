/**
 * Supporting classes for converting between resource types.  For example if you want to convert an InputStream
 * to a Reader you need to use a InputStreamReader but the Closeactions for the InputStream still need to be
 * executed on close.  So a reference to the InputStream must be kept.  The solution is to create an
 * `InputStreamReader with ResourceAdapting.Adapter`  The resource adapter will keep the reference to the underlying
 * Resource and a new CloseAction can be created that takes a ResourceAdapter and the original CloseAction and
 * executes the CloseAction on the referenced resource from the ResourceAdapter
